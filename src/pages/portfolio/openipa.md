  - title: What is IPA transcription and when is it needed?
    text: IPA transcription is the process of taking text from a given language and writing it in IPA, the International Phonetic Alphabet. OpenIPA is designed for use in transcription for Lyric Diction, where IPA is used to help a singer learn how to pronounce pieces in languages that may be foreign or unfamiliar to them.
  - title: What was the drive behind OpenIPA?
    text: There are a handful of resources online that offer IPA transcription, but these services are either hidden behind a sizeable paywall or are a complete black box, with no feedback or way to confirm if the transcription is accurate. OpenIPA was built and designed to tackle these issues, resulting in a tool that transcribes text accurately while giving a thorough breakdown of the various rules and methods used in the transcription process.
