  - title: What drove you to create Score Companion?
    text: Searching for sheet music can be incredibly frustrating. There are some great resources online, but once those resources are exhausted you're left blindly searching a number of sites in the hopes that you can find what you need. Score Companion aims to change all of that, allowing users to search for scores in one place.
  - title: What did you learn while creating Score Companion?
    text: Score Companion was my first attempt at a truly fullstack application, as many of the projects I have done up until this point were almost entirely frontend. I learned database fundamentals with SQL and PostgresQL, something I've been meaning to learn for awhile. I learned the basics of building a RESTful API, but later dropped REST in favor of GraphQL. Score Companion has allowed me to learn a great deal about the backend ecosystem, while helping to give back to the music community.
